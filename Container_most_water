Ques: You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). 

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. 

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Solution: 

class Solution { 

public: 

    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) { 

         int i=0; 

    int j=height.size()-1; 

    int area=INT_MIN; 

    while(i<j) 

    { 

       int l=height[i]; 

        int r=height[j]; 

        int minimum= min(l,r); 

        area= max(area,minimum*(j-i)); 

        if(l>r) j--; 

        else i++; 

    } 

    return area;  

} 

    

};
